# Paeonet-Firebase
The Paenet project aims to create a dynamic and interactive application accessible across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and web. We are utilizing Firebase as the backend infrastructure for data management, user authentication, and other integrations.

### Firebase Integration
- **Authentication**: We will implement Firebase Authentication for secure and efficient user login, allowing users to sign in using email/password, Google Sign-In, or social media accounts.
- **Data Storage**: The project will use Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data synchronization. Alternatively, we may opt for Cloud Firestore for more advanced querying capabilities and better scalability.

### Future Development with Node.js, React.js, and Vite
- **Node.js**: We plan to transition to Node.js for server-side development, leveraging its modular architecture and scalability. We will use the Express.js framework to build complex web applications.
- **React.js**: For the front end, we will employ React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic components, enabling us to create responsive and user-friendly web applications.
- **Vite**: As a modern development toolkit, Vite will enhance our development speed with efficient caching and module handling. It also supports various plugins that can boost developer productivity.
